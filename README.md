## Installation
 Unfortunately, the provided project description does not include any installation commands as it pertains to a resume rather than a software or application. A resume is a document that showcases an individual's personal information, education, work experience, skills, and other relevant details. It doesn't require installation instructions in the traditional sense.

If this resume was designed as a web-based portfolio using specific technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a framework such as React or Angular, then installation commands might be needed for those respective technologies. However, since no technology is mentioned in your project description, it's not possible to provide accurate installation instructions without further information.

In case you are planning to create a web-based resume using specific technologies, I would recommend researching the installation process for each of them based on their official documentation or popular tutorials online. Good luck with your project!
